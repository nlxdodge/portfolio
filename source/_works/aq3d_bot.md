[AQ3D](https://aq3d.com/) is the latest game from [Artix Entertainment](https://www.artix.com/).
Where I saw that the Discord bot from the un-official Discord server.

The only feature that was used a lot was to display the current server usage of all the normal servers. Which was the main focus of the Bot.
I also started working on a command to get the level and some stats that the AQ3D team exposes to us.
