#My new website is live!

This website was way quicker to build then expected, I used [JigSaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) to quickly template up a website and do some more styling to make a nice setup. And it doesn't use a database but rather markdown files for the contents.

Which is great for my use case, and I wish that I had done this way sooner.
