When I started doing Java I had didn't really like the extra bulk of XML, so for only that reason I choose to use Gradle for my first few projects that I created for my studies.
But low and behold I now get thrown in the working society and found out that all the companies I have worked for so far all use Maven.

"I had to switch..."

So thus begun my quest to learn Maven again (after having used it a couple of times when we had to do projects together).
