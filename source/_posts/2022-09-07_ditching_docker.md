Ditching Docker, is it really that easy? I get the question a lot on my work. Because everyone is acustomed to having the Docker GUI.
But even when you don't use the GUI and you need to upgrade to a version prior to version `3.6.0`? Well good luck with paying for a license now.

I did some searching around and found other tools that could be swapper for docker alltogether.
