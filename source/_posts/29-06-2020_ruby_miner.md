As a beginner ruby developer I always wonderd why nowhere in schools we get some Ruby. It's either beginning with something easy like [Python](https://python.org/) and when being more experienced I was using a combination of [Java](https://www.java.com/nl/), [C# .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and Javascript frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

While we did get tought the basics of Dynamic languages, we has to learn a lot on our own.
