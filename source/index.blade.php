  <h2>Some info about myself</h2>
  <p>I Started of my career with interests in computer science at a very young age. And took that to school where I choose to be an aspiring game developer. But soon
    found out that making games was almost the same as writing code for websites or other applications. Hence, I started to learn a new and higher degree for application
    development. At which I am running my last year of right now.</p>
  <p>Here is a short list of things I have experience with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Java, Ruby, Pyton, PHP, C# (Unity), C# .NET and more</li>
    <li>Vue & Angular with NPM and Yarn</li>
    <li>UML-Diagrams</li>
    <li>Creation of REST API's</li>
  </ul>
