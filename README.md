This website is made with [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/). For installation instructions see [Installation](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/installation/).

## Basic rundown for this project

Clone the project, run `docker-compose up -d --build` and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the local variant.

## Todo's

- Fix hot reloading for docker-compose so I don't have to install all dependencies every time

## Want to use Jigsaw yourself?

When trying to create a new project, install PHP, composer and use the following commands:

`composer require tightenco/jigsaw` followed by `./vendor/bin/jigsaw init` to setup a blank slate to work with.
